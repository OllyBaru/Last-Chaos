# Shaiya Episode 6

An open-source effort to make episode 5 servers compatible with episode 6 clients.

## Environment

Windows 10

Visual Studio 2022

C++ 23

## Prerequisites

[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

[Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

## Injection

Cheat Engine isn't guaranteed to work for everyone. It's not an issue with the application or the libraries. The libraries have an export defined in the main headers.
